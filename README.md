# Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D. Project

<br>

#Overview 

<br>
MVCFilmSite is a full stack application that uses CRUD concepts to allow the user of our application to create, read, update, and/or delete films in our database.<br>
<br>
On the Landing Site the user may choose to enter an ID to search for a specific film,<br>
add a new film to the Relational Database or Search all film titles and descriptions.<br>
If a match is not found for either Searches the user is notified that no results are present<br>
and allowed to click a link to return to the landing page.<br
If a match is found the film or films are displayed with all fields,<br>
The user may choose to delete or edit the results of their search and submit the changes<br>
to the relational database.<br>
If the user chooses to edit a film, all fields for the film table may be edited and all existing values<br>
are displayed to be edited. in the event of a failure the user will recieve an error.
if the edit is successful the new film will be displayed.<br>
If the user decides to delete a film, the user will be alerted if the operation was successful or not<br>
and can return to the Landing site by clicking a link.<br>
<br>

#Lessons Learned
<br>
During this project we learned how to utilize CRUD operations and jsp files to manipulate data in a<br>
MySQL relational Database.<br>
One of our biggest problems was figuring out how to properly map the url so all key reference values<br>
would be passed to the JSP files ie: how to utilize Dependency Injection to complete the objectives.<br>
We also utilized SpringTools form:form tag so we could bind the field values to the backing object(the film model).<br> 
We utilized pair programming as well as split objective programming and were able to work<br>
fairly smoothly with good communication.<br>
Working in Full Stack helped highlight the uses of:<br>
- compartmentalizing methods, classes, and files wherever possible. -->*****OOP!******<--<br>
- Dependency Injection<br>
- COMMUNICATION when working in a team environment<br>
- JDBC Database Connectivity<br>
- Command Objects. <br>
